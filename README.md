one-nil
=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wagnerandrade/one-nil.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wagnerandrade/one-nil)

An open-source football (soccer) casual management game made with coffeescript/javascript (work in progress).

How to?
-------

Right now the one-nil project is a class library with a basic teams/players/league iteration. You can follow these steps to take a look in this lib in action:

  1. install dependencies and run tests:

    ```
    npm install  
    npm test
    ```

  2. open the `functional-test.log` file to see a league in action.

What is next?
-------------

  - Coach (and human iteration);
  - Player energy and moral;
  - Player transference;
  - Player/team/league historic;
  - Squad formation;
